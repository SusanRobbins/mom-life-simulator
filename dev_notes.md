# Dev Notes – Mom Life Simulator: Sanity Mode

## Overview

This project began as a simple, humorous Python script to simulate a day in the life of a mom with toddlers. Originally, it was a flat loop based on time-of-day input with some sarcastic, reality-based print statements.

As I gained confidence in Python basics—particularly functions, conditionals, loops, and user input—I decided to refine the code structure and introduce a **sanity point system** to simulate emotional stamina and create an actual "win/lose" mechanic.

## Key Changes

- Broke out scenario blocks into functions for modularity and readability  
- Added a `main()` guard for best practice and reusability  
- Introduced a sanity meter (starts at 5) to track mental survival across gameplay  
- Improved input handling to accept messy capitalization/spacing  
- Kept the tone consistent with the theme: humorous, real, and just a little unhinged

## Next Steps (if expanded)

If I revisit this, I’d consider:
- Adding randomized toddler events for replay value  
- Displaying the sanity meter visually  
- Logging user choices to simulate "mom stats"  
- Packaging it as a simple command-line game module

## Why It Matters

This project isn’t just code—it reflects the chaos of parenting, the need for levity, and the way even small technical steps can give structure to an otherwise unpredictable reality.
